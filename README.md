# Decentralized Identity System

The Decentralized Identity System DID (`did:dis`) standard, proposed by [District Labs](http://districtlabs.com/) and [Disco](https://disco.xyz/), is a blockchain based DID (decentralized identifier) standard that balances ease-of-use with support for full life-cycle management.

Giving users a low-friction (and oftentimes free) approach to bootstraping a blockchain based Smart Wallet, with built-in support for the W3C [decentralized identifier](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and [verifiable credential](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) standards.

The `did:dis` standard relies on a combination of **counterfactual statements**, **offchain data storage** and **onchain public key infrastructure**.

Giving people all over the world the ability to bootstrap a new decentralized identifier using only **2 private key signatures**, while maintaing the ability to progressively strengthen the security, as they reach new distributed systems commitment thresholds.

The proposed `did:dis` standard uses the following concepts, standards and technologies:

- Decentralized Identifier Documents (DID)
- Counterfactual Statements
- Offchain Data Storage for Cryptographically Signed Messages
- Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (EIP-3668)
- Account Abstraction (EIP-4337 i.e. Smart Wallets)
- Onchain Public Key Infrastructure
- Intents, Authorization and Object Capabilities (Delegatable)
